## IP Addresses:

The most significant protocol at layer 3 (also called the network layer) is the Internet Protocol, or IP. IP is the standard for routing packets across interconnected networks--hence, the name internet. It is an encapsulating protocol similar to the way Ethernet is an encapsulating protocol.

//Find info about your IP addresses:

```
 $ ifconfig
```

IPv4: inet 127.0.0.1

IPv6: inet6

> NAT - network address translation

Private IP addresses - are not used anywhere on public internet, reserved for private LANs
